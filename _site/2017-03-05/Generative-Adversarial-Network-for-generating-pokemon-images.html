<p>Researchers from Insilico Medicine proposed an approach of artificially intelligent drug discovery using GANs.
The goal is to train the Generator to sample drug candidates for a given disease as precisely as possible to existing drugs from a Drug Database.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*--g8RQpR-Hofpa8G." alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>

<p>After training, it’s possible to generate a drug for a previously incurable disease using the Generator, and using the Discriminator to determine whether the sampled drug actually cures the given disease.</p>

<h2 id="other-types-of-gans">Other Types of GANs</h2>

<h3 id="deep-convolutional-gans-dcgans">Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)</h3>

<p>Important Discoveries</p>

<ul>
  <li>Batch normalization is a must in both networks.</li>
  <li>Fully hidden connected layers are not a good idea.</li>
  <li>Avoid pooling, simply stride your convolutions!</li>
  <li>ReLU activations are your friend (almost always).</li>
  <li>Vanilla GANs could work on simple datasets, but DCGANs are far better.</li>
  <li>DCGANS are solid baseline to compare with your fancy new state-of-the-art GAN algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conditional-gans">Conditional GANs</h3>

<p><img src="http://guimperarnau.com/files/blog/Fantastic-GANs-and-where-to-find-them/cGAN_overview.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>

<h4 id="cgans-use-extra-label-information-this-results-in-better-quality-images-and-being-able-to-control--to-an-extent--how-generated-images-will-look">CGANs use extra label information. This results in better quality images and being able to control – to an extent – how generated images will look.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Here we have conditional information Y that describes some aspect of the data.</li>
  <li>if we are dealing with faces, Y could describe attributes such as hair color or gender.</li>
  <li>Then, this attribute information is inserted in both the generator and the discriminator.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://guimperarnau.com/files/blog/Fantastic-GANs-and-where-to-find-them/cGAN_disentanglement.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>

<h3 id="conditional-gans-are-interesting-for-two-reasons">Conditional GANs are interesting for two reasons:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>As you are feeding more information into the model, the GAN learns to exploit it and, therefore, is able to generate better samples.</li>
  <li>We have two ways of controlling the representations of the images. Without the conditional GAN, all the image information was encoded in Z. With cGANs, as we add conditional information Y, now these two — Z and Y — will encode different information. For example, let’s suppose Y encodes the digit of a hand-written number (from 0 to 9). Then, Z would encode all the other variations that are not encoded in Y. That could be, for example, the style of the number (size, weight, rotation, etc).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wasserstein-gans">Wasserstein GANs</h3>

<h4 id="wgans-change-the-loss-function-to-include-the-wasserstein-distance-as-a-result-wassgans-have-loss-functions-that-correlate-with-image-quality-also-training-stability-improves-and-is-not-as-dependent-on-the-architecture">WGANs Change the loss function to include the Wasserstein distance. As a result, WassGANs have loss functions that correlate with image quality. Also, training stability improves and is not as dependent on the architecture.</h4>

WTFFFFfff how about this instead…
<img src="http://guimperarnau.com/files/blog/Fantastic-GANs-and-where-to-find-them/WassGAN_loss_function.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>GANs have always had problems with convergence and, as a consequence, you don’t really know when to stop training them. In other words, the loss function doesn’t correlate with image quality. This is a big headache because:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>you need to be constantly looking at the samples to tell whether you model is training correctly or not.</li>
  <li>you don’t know when to stop training (no convergence).</li>
  <li>you don’t have a numerical value that tells you how well are you tuning the parameters.</li>
  <li>For example, see these two uninformative loss functions plots of a DCGAN perfectly able to generate MNIST samples:</li>
</ol>

<p>This interpretability issue is one of the problems that Wasserstein GANs aims to solve. How? GANs can be interpreted to minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is 0 if the real and fake distribution don’t overlap (which is usually the case). So, instead of minimizing the JS divergence, the authors use the Wasserstein distance, which describes the distance between the “points” from one distribution to the other.</p>

<p>So, WassGAN has a loss function that correlates with image quality and enables convergence. It is also more stable, meaning that it is not as dependent on the architecture. For example, it works quite well even if you remove batch normalization or try weird architectures.</p>

<h3 id="use-if">use if</h3>
<ul>
  <li>you are looking for a state-of-the-art GAN with the highest training stability.</li>
  <li>you want an informative and interpretable loss function.</li>
</ul>
